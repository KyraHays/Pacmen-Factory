# Pacmen-Factory

## Project Name:
PacMan Factory

## Description:
This factory randomly places a pacman at the click of the button. The pacman will then start randomly moving across the screen once "Start Game" is pressed.

## Installation / How to run:
Copy the .css, .js, and .html files in the same directory, load the index.html file into a web browser

## Roadmap:
I would like to add an element that each new pacman would chase around the screen.
